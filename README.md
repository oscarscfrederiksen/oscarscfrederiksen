# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscarscfrederiksen/oscarscfrederiksen/master/Hand-Waving.gif" width="70px" style="clip: rect(0px, 0px, 100px, 0px)">

My name is Oscar Frederiksen and I'm a self-taught programmer (most interested in app & web development - but by no means exclusively). I'm from Denmark ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°, living in London and currently working on launching multiple apps, startups and busieness ventures!

## ðŸ”­ What I'm doing now?

I'm working on a few things and have a few potential projects on the backburner:
<!--
- The VolunteerMe App: Repo coming soon! ðŸ”¨ðŸ”¨
<!--
- The (temporarily labelled) Notion-Obsidian Crossbreed: Repo and name coming soon! ðŸ”¨ðŸ”¨

- An AI powered rock, paper, scissors robot: Repo coming soon!
- An IDE, and a programming language: Just a personal challenge!

- Acing the OCR Computer Science GCSE!

## ðŸŒ±  What I'm learning?

I have plenty to work on, however I always love learning new things!

I'm currently working through Harvard's CS50x course - just to fill in any potential basic gaps in my knowledge!
I'm learning C and C# in Unity, just for fun!

## ðŸ’¬ Talk to me about...

ANYTHING! I love an intelligent conversation about nearly every topic! I would love to discuss politics, computers, programming, science - anything! And well if you're looking to get a project, business, startup, whatever it may be chances are I'd love to collaborate and be a partner. For that you would need to know:

## ðŸ“«  How to reach me

I'm soon to be setting up social media accounts, will post them when they're ready!
But for now email me, any time of the day, at: business.oscarfrederiksen@gmail.com

# Stay Awesome!
